## Assignment Question

Question 1: Build a Complete Database Management System

## Objective:

Design and implement a full-featured relational database using MySQL.

## Instructions:

Choose a real-world use case (e.g., Library Management, Student Records, Clinic Booking System, Inventory Tracking, E-commerce Store, etc.).

Create a relational database schema that includes:

Well-structured tables.

Proper constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE).

Relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many, where applicable).

Use SQL to implement your design.

Deliverables:

A single .sql file containing:

CREATE DATABASE statement

CREATE TABLE statements

Relationship constraints


âš¡ Notes

1. All IDs are BIGINT (scales better than INT for large datasets).

2. Foreign keys enforce relationships in the same order as your dependency chain.

3. created_at, shipped_at, etc. are stored as DATETIME.

4. cost, retail_price, and sale_price use DECIMAL(10,2) for money precision.

5. email in users is UNIQUE.
